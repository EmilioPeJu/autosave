<h2 align="center">Release 4-0</h2>

<P>
Note version numbering got messed up because the 3.13 and 3.14 versions are on
separate development tracks.  The 3.14 module took its number from the 'std'
module, (from which it was extracted), while the 3.13 version (which was never
a module) took its number from the save_restore.c file version.  To avoid more
confusion, the module version number has been bumped up past the most recent
(and, I hope, final) 3.13 version, which was 3.5.

<p align="left">Differences from version 2-3 (i.e., synApps 5.0):

<ul> <li><p>This version can save and restore array-valued PV's.  Array values
are saved using database access, so you can't name array PV's hosted by some
other IOC, as you can for scalar PV's.   Array PV's are restored, using
database access, in the second pass of reboot_restore (at
initHookAfterInitDatabase), by which time array storage presumably has been
allocated.  It's not an error to include array PV's in a .sav file that is
restored during reboot_restore's first pass, but reboot_restore won't try
to restore them then.

<li><p>This version supports PV's whose data type will change from DBF_NOACCESS to
some writable type during record initialization.  (Some genSub record fields
behave in this way, and previous version of save_restore could not restore
them.)  It's not an error to include such PV's in a .sav file that is
restored during reboot_restore's first pass, but reboot_restore won't try
to restore them then.

<li><p>The database and medm-display files by which save_restore reports its status
to the user have been thoroughly reworked.  Previously, the datebase and medm
display file had to be hardwired with the names of save_restore files.  Now,
there are eight sets of save_restore status PV's, used on a first-come,
first-served basis.

<li><p>The order in which PV's occur in the .sav file is no longer reversed from
the ordering in the corresponding .req file.

<li><p>The test for valid .sav files now permits files to end either with
"<END>?" or "<END>??", where "?" is any character.  This allows dos files,
which end with "\r\n", to be restored.

<li><p>Added the functions dbrestoreShow(void) and save_restoreShow(int verbose),
callable from the ioc console.

<li><p>Under vxWorks, this version can manage its own NFS mount, and will
dismount/remount the file system when save_restoreRemountThreshold I/O
errors have occurred.

<li><p>Many function and variable names have changed.
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-3</h2>

<p align="left">This is the first release of the synApps autosave module.
Version numbering for this module begins with 2.3 because this module
was split from version 2.2 of the std module, and I wanted to retain
the CVS histories of module contents.</p>

This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5.

Differences from software as previously released in std 2.2:
<ul>
<li><p>reload_xxx_set() was hanging because epicsMutex was
being used for intertask signalling.  Changed to epicsEvent.
<p>Thread priorities adjusted.
<li><p>Save files with versions earlier than 1.8 are exempt
from the ends-with-"<END>" test.

</ul>
