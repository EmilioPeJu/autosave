<h1 align="center">autosave Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-3</h2>

<p align="left">This is the first release of the synApps autosave module.
Version numbering for this module begins with 2.3 because this module
was split from version 2.2 of the std module, and I wanted to retain
the CVS histories of module contents.</p>

This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5.

Differences from software as previously released in std 2.2:
<ul>
<li><p>reload_xxx_set() was hanging because epicsMutex was
being used for intertask signalling.  Changed to epicsEvent.
<p>Thread priorities adjusted.
<li><p>Save files with versions earlier than 1.8 are exempt
from the ends-with-"<END>" test.

</ul>
